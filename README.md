# My Web Development Project

## Project Overview

This project is part of my journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), an open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development. The goal of this particular project is to solidify my understanding of **HTML** and **CSS fundamentals**, focusing on clean structure, semantic markup, and responsive design principles.

The project involves recreating a basic website layout using only HTML and CSS, with emphasis on best practices, accessibility, and visual styling.

## Objectives

- Build and structure a multi-section web page using semantic HTML.
- Apply CSS styling to create a visually appealing layout.
- Practice working with box models, flexbox, and responsive design.
- Get comfortable using developer tools to inspect and debug HTML/CSS.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS styling and layout techniques (box model, flexbox)
- Responsive web design principles
- File organization and version control with Git
- Use of VS Code and browser developer tools

## Self-Reflection

(Write this after completing the project)

This project helped me become more confident in writing clean and semantic HTML. I now have a better grasp of how CSS interacts with the structure of the page, and I feel more comfortable using flexbox to control layout. It was a great exercise to practice reading and following design patterns, and I feel more equipped to tackle more complex front-end challenges going forward.
